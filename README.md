# Haskell C- Compiler
This is an in-progress compiler for the [C- language](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs57/Project/C-%20Spec.pdf).
Eventually it will compile C- code into d16 assembly files, which will subsequently be assembled with the d16 assembler.

To compile the program, run `cabal configure` and `cabal build`.
